E-Health is a medical IOT system , a solution proposed for people who need frequent medical 
examination at home, especially for those who can't afford displacment to medical institutions due to either the distance or a certain handicap.
or more generally for any persons that wants a continious track of his/her health.

Our kit is composed of 2 products , an IOT monitoring box and smart bracelet connected to
a mobile application

The medical box contains different sensors inputs to permit measurement of :

Heartbeat , blood saturation ,blood pressure ,temperature ,humidty and a glucometer.

As mentionned before the main objectif is to provide medical feedback from patients in addition to exmaination and diagnostics at home .
data are collected when the patient uses the box , then data is sent to the approriate 
institution (maybe a private doctor , a public hospital , clinics etc ....).

The box is provided with a Tablet that contains a user interface to display the data measured and also a user guide.
